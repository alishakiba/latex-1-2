LaTeX II
========

Eventually, this project will be part of a larger project compriseing
both LaTeX I and LaTeX II. For now, the prequel to this project is 
available on OverLeaf:

	overleaf.com/read/yhcyjnnfmbhk

LaTeX I and II are a series of workshops provided by Cardiff University's 
Doctoral Academy (previously the University Graduate College). The 
materials used for the four workshops which make up LaTeX II ['this 
project'] are provided here. 

LaTeX I and II are a modified and extended version of materials produced 
by UK TUG volunteers ['original project'] for a course provided for 
beginning LaTeX users. The materials were adapted for LaTeX I and II by 
Clea F. Rees.

Both the original work and modifications are 
licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported 
License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

The original project is available as a GitHub repository maintained by
Joseph Wright from https://github.com/uktug/latex-beginners-course/.

LaTeX II includes four workshops:
1. Macros
2. Biblatex/Biber
3. Beamer
4. Floats ; Plotting Data
[The second half of the fourth is based on student preferences, so may vary.]

Summary of Changes
==================

+ The file README.markdown from the original project is included as 
  UK-TUG-README.markdown. 
+ Files required to build the project with make and to produce HTML are
  omitted from the modified project. However, LaTeX II includes a 
  **highly experimental** Makefile for possible use on Unix-ish systems. 
+ The modified project uses a set of common configuration files. 
+ The format of slides, handouts and tutor notes have been customised.
* The handouts originally used US letter paper. This is corrected in the
* The margin sizes have been increased so that notes for tutors are included
  modified project.
+ Material on BibTeX is converted into a workshop on Biblatex/Biber. Adaption
  included preparation of a Biblatex 'cheat sheet', now published on CTAN.
* Diagrams are redrawn using TikZ.
* Considerable material has been added for all topics in LaTeX II and
  appendices have been added to supplement the handouts.
* The fourth workshop in LaTeX II includes a new section on the use of 
  pgfplots to plot graphs from external data.
  in the printable area of the page.
+ Further changes were made where necessary to adapt the materials for local
  conditions.

Prerequisites
=============

Either links or copies of the files pgfplotsexample.tex and
pgfplotsexample.pdf are required to compile the documents for the fourth
workshop. These are part of the pgfplots package, available from CTAN at 

	http://ctan.org/pkg/pgfplots

To add the files or links, create a sub-directory at
gweithdy-da-2-pellach/handouts and place the two files or links there.

In a Unix-ish environment with a standard TeX Live installation

    cd <top level of working copy of project>
    mkdir -p gweithdy-latex-da-2-pellach/handouts
    pushd gweithdy-latex-da-2-pellach/handouts
    ln -s $(kpsewhich -var TEXMFDIST)/doc/latex/pgfplots/pgfplotsexample.* ./
    popd

where <top level of working copy of project> is an appropriate path should 
do the job.
