LaTeX for Beginners
===================

The [UK TeX Users' Group](http://uk.tug.org) periodically runs a course for new
LaTeX users. The course notes and examples are here.

There are three master documents: one to make the slides, one to make the
handouts and one to make the tutor handouts, which include timings and other
reminders.

Using the slides
----------------

The slides are designed to cover the basic material of the course. We tend
to add extra ideas in as the course runs. What seems appropriate depends on
the group of students.

Running a course
----------------

Experience suggests that the material here works well for a full day course.
For this to work, the students need to have a computer already set up to
use LaTeX. A full [TeX Live](http://tug.org/texlive) installation is probably
the easiest way to go.

The timing given in the tutor notes is approximate. Depending on the group,
something like half an hour at the end of the day for general questions seems
to work well.
